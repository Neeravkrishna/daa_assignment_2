    <div class="question"><h2>What do you mean by sorting?</h2>
        <br><p>
            Sorting an array means arranging the elements of the array in a certain order. <br>
Generally, sorting in an array is done to arrange the elements in increasing or decreasing order.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <u>Data Retrieval:</u> <br>One of the most common uses of sorting is to retrieve data in a specific order. <br>For example, when you search for a name in a phonebook, the entries are sorted alphabetically. <br> Sorting makes it easier and more efficient to find information.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><u>Data Presentation:</u> <br>Sorted data is often easier for humans to interpret and work with. Whether you're looking at a list of products on an e-commerce website, a list of names on a spreadsheet,<br> or a list of files in a directory, having the data sorted can enhance user experience.</li>
            <br>
            <li><u>Data Analysis:</u> <br>Sorting is crucial in data analysis tasks. <br> It allows you to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies more easily. <br>For example, sorting sales data by date allows you to see how sales have changed over time.</li>
